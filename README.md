# Queue-Simulator 

Is a program written in java that simulates a SINGLE SERVER QUEUING SYSTEM.
It reads input data from a text file using a BufferedReader.i.e:
- Mean interarrival time
- Mean service time
- Number of customers

It comprises of the following methods: 
1) void initialize(void)
2) void timing (void) 
3) void arrive (void)
4) void depart(void)
5) void report(void)
6) void update_time_av9_stats{void)
7) float expon (float mean)

The above are coordinated by the main method, and the final output is in a textfile, outfile.txt.
The output comprises of :
- Average delay in queue
- Average number in queue
- Server utilization
- Time simulation ended

### Running the program 
Requires the project to be opened in a java enabled IDE such as NetBeans and then run.
